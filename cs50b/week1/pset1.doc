Write an algorithm (i.e., step-by-step instructions) via which someone could walk or drive from some origin to some destination, perhaps a path that you yourself tend to travel. Take care to specify what the origin and destination that you have in mind. And take care to use loops and conditions as needed, particularly if there might be obstacles (e.g., red lines). Assume that your algorithm will be executed by a robot (or lost friend) who will follow your directions precisely.
Algorithm – Car Ride in Mumbai
Origin – Bandra Train Station to Destination – Khar Train Station by Car

Car Ride in Mumbai
Drive “north” for 500 meters
When you reach the signal
If signal is “green”
	Turn right 
else
	Wait for the signal to turn “green”
	When signal turns “green”
	Turn right
Keep driving “north” for another 250 meters
When you reach the junction
	If the junction is “clear”
		Keep driving north for another 150 meters
	else
Wait for the junction to be “clear”
		When the junction is “clear”
		Keep driving north for another 300 meters
When you reach the signal
If signal is “green”
	Turn right 
else
	Wait for the signal to turn “green”
	When signal turns “green”
	Turn right
Keep driving “north” for another 200 meters
Once 200 meters completed, you have reached your destination.
